# DVMHost for DVM V24 Board 

This is how to build and configure DVMHost for use with the [DVM V24 board](https://store.w3axl.com/products/dvm-v24-usb-converter-for-v24-equipment) on a Quantar repeater.

Assumes:
* You have a Debian 12 x86_64 install with root access on a computer which the DVM V24 board will plug into. 
* There is a known working ENF for DVMHost to login to either on this same or another computer. 

## Clone

As root:

```
apt install git g++ cmake
cd /usr/src
git clone https://github.com/DVMProject/dvmhost.git
git clone https://github.com/tsawyer/dvm-project-notes.git
cd dvmhost
```

or to update

```
cd /usr/src/dvmhost
git pull
```

## Compile and Install DVMHost

Follow the instructions at [DVMProject README.md](https://github.com/DVMProject/dvmhost/blob/master/README.md).

* Do install the dependicies.
* Don't install the cross compilers
* No options are needed for cmake. Just do `cmake ..` That compiles the project C code. It doesn't take long.
* The `make` command builds the project and may take a long time.
* Finally do `make strip` and `make old_install`. This removes debug code and copies the project to `/opt/dvm`.

This complete the build of DVMHost.

## Compile and Flash V24 Board Firmware

These steps are from [github.com/DVMProject/dvmv24](https://github.com/DVMProject/dvmv24). You should read it.

If your DVM V24 board has current firmware skip down to **DVM Host Configuration**.
If the pre-built [binary firmware](https://github.com/DVMProject/dvmv24/releases) is current skip down to **Flash Firmware**.
Chances are neither is true and you'll need to build and flash new firmware.

### Compile Firmware
The ARM toolchain is needed to build the latest firmware. On Debian and derivatives, 
the package youâ€™re looking for is gcc-arm-none-eabi, thank you [Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/377345/installing-arm-none-eabi-gcc).

```
apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

With the ARM tool chain installed, build the firmware:

```
cd /usr/src
git clone https://github.com/DVMProject/dvmv24.git
cd dvm24/fw
make
```



### Flash Firmware

To flash the V24 board firmware a ST-link V2 programmer is needed. Programmers are inexpensive and available from Amazon, DigiKey, Mouser, eBay and etc. 

Connect four wires from the programmer to the V24 board. The V24 board pins are **labled on the underside** of the circuit board. 
 * 3.3 Volts
 * GND
 * DIO
 * CLK

Install st-link flash programer: `apt install stlink-tools`

Assuming the firmware was built in `/usr/src/dvmv24/fw/`: 

```
cd /usr/src/dvmv24/fw/
make flash
```

You should see:

```

```

## DMV Host Configuration

* Copy the configuration file `cp /opt/dvm/config.example.yml /opt/dvm/config.yml`.
* Edit the configuration file `nano /opt/dvm/config.yml`.
* Under `log:`
  * Change `fileLevel:` to 6.
  * Change `filePath:` to /opt/dvm/log
  * Change `activityFilePath:` to /opt/dvm/log
* Under `network:`
  * Change `id:` to admin provided peerID.
  * Change `address:` to the FNE IP address provided by your admin.
  * Change `password:` to the FNE password provided by your admin.
* Under `protocols:`
  * Under `dmr:` change `enable:` to false.
  * Under `p25:` insure `enable:` is true.
  * Under `nxdn:` insure `enable:` is false.
* Under `system:`
  * Change `idenity:` to YOUR CALL SIGN.
  * Under `info:` optionally change the values.
* Under `cwId:`
  * Change `enable:` to false.
* Under `modem:`
  * Under `protocol:` change `type:` to "uart".
  * Under `protocol:` change `mode:` to "dfsi".
  * Under `uart:` change the `port:` "/dev/ttyACM0". To find port insure the V24 board is connected to a USB port. Then do `ls -l /dev/ttyACM*`. 
  * Under `dfsi:` change `diu:` to false.
* Under `iden_table` change `file:` to /opt/dvm/iden_table.dat
* Under `radio_id:` change `file:` to /opt/dvm/radio_id.dat
* Under `talkgroup_id:` change `file:` to /opt/dvm/talkgroup_rules.dat

## Testing

Launch DVMHost in the foreground `/opt/dvm/bin/dvmhost -f -c /opt/dvm/config.yml`. You should see it login to the FNE after a few moments.

If that looks good then control-c out of dvmhost.

## Install DVMhost Service

Insure proper ownership with:

```
cd /opt/dvm
chown -R dvmhost:dvmhost *
```

Install the service with these commands:

```
cd /usr/src/dvmhost/build
make old_install-service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable dvmhost.service
systemctl start dvmhost.service
```
Use `systemctl status dvmhost.service` to see if dvmhost is running.

Use `journalctl -u dvmhost -f` to monitor the console.
